Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
0 : 2 : 4 : 6 : 8 :

#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')

This program first defines a function called doubleL which takes in a number as a paramter. It then defines res as an empty list and appends all the numbers from 0 to n-1 doubled before returning it. The program then uses this function in a for loop with n=5 to print out these doubled numbers and replaces the end of each with ' : ' instead of new line.

#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')

This program uses comprehension to create a list to iterate over. The list is compriesed of all the numbers from 0 to 4 inclusive doubled. This list is then printed with the end of each number being replaced with ' : ' instead of new line.

#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')

This program defines a genearator function that generates values from 0 to n-1 doubled. It then iterates over these values with the end of each number being replaced with ' : ' instead of new line.

What type of function is doubleG(n)? What is the advantage of using such a function?
This is a gernator function which allows us to generate values each time the function is iterated over instead of all at once. The code will run until it hites yield, the generator object will return the generated value and contiue the loop the next time it is called. This is useful when we need to display these values but want to save memory and avoid storing them.
